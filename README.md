# ü§ñ TerraScribe: The AI-Powered Infrastructure as Code Assistant

TerraScribe is a web-based tool that leverages the power of Amazon Bedrock (Anthropic's Claude 3 Sonnet) to translate plain English requests into production-ready Infrastructure as Code. This project automates the often tedious process of writing boilerplate Terraform and Kubernetes configuration files, allowing DevOps engineers to build faster and more consistently.

## üìñ About The Project

As a DevOps engineer, I know that writing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is essential for modern cloud management. However, it can also be time-consuming and requires remembering the specific syntax for hundreds of different resources.

TerraScribe was built to solve this problem. It acts as an intelligent assistant, allowing a user to describe the infrastructure they need in natural language. The application then uses a powerful Large Language Model (LLM) via Amazon Bedrock to generate the corresponding code, following security and best practices.

**Key Goals:**
*   **Accelerate Development:** Drastically reduce the time it takes to write standard IaC configurations.
*   **Enforce Best Practices:** Use prompt engineering to guide the AI to produce secure and well-structured code.
*   **Explore GenAI in DevOps:** Demonstrate a practical application of Generative AI to solve a real-world DevOps challenge.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

*   An AWS account with access to Amazon Bedrock and the 'Claude 3 Sonnet' model enabled in the `us-east-1` region.
*   Python 3.9+ installed on your local machine.
*   AWS credentials configured locally (e.g., via `aws configure`).

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Abhishekjain1106/terrascribe-ai-iac-generator.git
    cd terrascribe-ai-iac-generator
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```sh
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the application:**
    ```sh
    streamlit run app.py
    ```


## üí° Usage

Once the application is running, navigate to the provided `localhost` URL in your browser.

1.  Use the sidebar to select whether you want to generate `Terraform (AWS)` or `Kubernetes (YAML)` code.
2.  In the main text area, type your request in plain English. Be as descriptive as possible.
3.  Click the "Generate Code" button and wait for the AI to produce the result.
